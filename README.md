## **Topic and Interests:**

As students currently working and soon to be transitioning into full time employment, the dataset is highly relevant to the team. Mental health in the workplace is rapidly becoming a more common topic, and knowing what factors may cause employee attrition is good for anyone to know. We are interested in this dataset because we want to understand the leading factors that lead to employee attrition and more importantly, how we could use that to our benefit. What point does an employee begin to be dissatisfied with their workplace? If some factors are very positive, and others very negative, would they balance out? or are negative factors much more weighted? Are people who jump around from company to company more satisfied than people who stay long term? Furthermore, we are also interested in why such factors would play a role in employee attrition to get a deeper understanding and rationalize the data. Lastly, we think this dataset is also broad enough that all members of the team will have their separate unique motivations which will make the project more meaningful for everyone.

## **Dataset Description:**

The HR employee attrition report looks at a wide variety of employees and analyzes the different potential factors that may cause employee attrition. This dataset aims to predict employee attrition by analyzing related to employee background, job conditions, and environment variables. Furthermore, the collection is made up of 2068 observations and 35 attributes. Among the 35 attributes collected in the data, a few are age, education, hourly rate, job role, and of course attrition. The data types collected through these attributes are 26 integers, 6 strings, and 3 booleans. Additionally, the string data collected is mostly ordinal data that is used to gauge the general satisfaction or likeliness for a certain attribute. In other words, employee subjective satisfaction to factors such as they work life balance or their job. Lastly, a large portion of the attributes data is categorical which was used to identify levels among the employees like frequency of activity or educational attainment.
