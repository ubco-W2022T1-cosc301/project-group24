### **Figure 3.1:** Bar Graph Visualization by Categorical Data

This is a visualization representation of attrition percentages across a variety of different categories using a bar graph. There are a multitude of different insights that can be gathered from this regarding the significance, effect, and correlation of each category to attrition. Some notable points are sales representatives have a staggering 40% attrition rate, traveling more frequently actually increases attrition, and job, education, job involvement, work-life balance, and stock option levels all generally work towards decreasing attrition.

### **Figure 3.2:** Line Graph Visualization by Numerical Data

This is a visualization representation of attrition percentages for different attributes using a line graph. The visualizations emphasize the relationship of the numerical values to attrition percentages which cover the numerical data thus including the figure 3.1, covers all the columns for the data set. Some notable insights we can gather from the visualizations are that generally as total working years and age increase, the attrition rate decrease which creates an inverse relationship. Lastly, contradictory to most assumptions, employee hourly rate does not seem to have a significant effect on attrition

### **Figure 3.3:** Bar Graph Visualization Split by Attrition

This is a visualization representation of attrition percentages for different attributes using a bar graph split by attrition responses. Similar visualizations to figure 3.1 but highlights the individual responses instead of the percentages. Similar insights from figure 3.1 can be gathered from this figure as well. Regarding unmentioned insights, it can be seen that a few sections of each category has extremely low responses which could cause high variance with the data and thus make it unreliable. An example of this would be the highest/lowest levels of numerous categories and human resources with do not exceede a few hundred responses
