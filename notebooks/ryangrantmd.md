### **Figure 1.3:** Worklife Balance vs Job Involvement

From this data, we can see that the large majority of people reported a work-life balance of 3/4 and job involvement of 3/4. Something interesting to note is that as the total amount is higher, however, the proportional amount are staying relatively the same. This means that Job involvement does not seem to affect work-life balance.

Finally, how does job involvement impact environmental satisfaction? From looking at this graph you can see that the proportional amounts of people reporting change as you increase job involvement. At a job involvement level of 3, you are more likely to have higher environmental satisfaction. When compared to a job involvement of 4 you will have lower levels of 3-4 environmental satisfaction.
